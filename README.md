# Mailbox F\*cker

Cause havoc in other people's inboxes, spams the crap out of them

How it works:
- uses [this api](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to generate random words
- uses customized settings in the [customization.yaml](https://github.com/Mootbing/mail-fucker/blob/main/customize.yaml)
- more in-depth info can be found in [comments next to the code](https://github.com/Mootbing/mail-fucker/blob/main/RipGmail.py)

Dependencies:
- Yagmail (sending mail)
- Pyyaml (for yaml processing)
- Datetime (for timestamps)
- Time (for delays)
- Requests (to scrape api)

# Does it work?

Yea... It's really effective

# How to use?
This program runs fully in the background! So you can do anything you want while it's going crazy ;)

[Just check out the .yaml file after cloning and fill in your credencials](https://github.com/Mootbing/mail-fucker/blob/main/customize.yaml)

Settings & customization of the script is also in that file

**Make sure to turn this feature on!**

Else the script will be blocked by Gmail. Also make sure you are using an alt account so you don't get banned. Happy spamming.

(btw I am not legally responsable for what you do with this. just to clarify)
